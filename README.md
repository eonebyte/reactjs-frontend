# ReactJS Frontend with Authentication and MDB Bootstrap

This repository contains a client-side template for a ReactJS-based web application, complete with user authentication. It leverages the power of ReactJS and ViteJS as the build tool, along with the user-friendly UI components provided by MDB Bootstrap.

# Technologies
React + Vite
This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

User Authentication: Secure user authentication system is integrated, providing a foundation for user management.

## State Management with [Recoil](https://recoiljs.org/)

Recoil is used for efficient state management in this project. It provides a robust and predictable way to handle global application state.

[MDB Bootstrap](https://mdbootstrap.com/docs/react/): A stylish and feature-rich UI framework based on Bootstrap, ensuring a professional look and feel for your application.
